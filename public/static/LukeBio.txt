Hi! My name is Luther Jensen and I'm an {{{age}}} year old {{{gradelevel}}} at {{{school}}}. Some of the main things I enjoy to do in my free time are hang out with friends, play videogames, and read. I enjoy traveling and meeting new people. I would consider myself a very charismatic person and I am very extroverted.  I've been programming since I was 14 and have loved it since. I have over a year of experience in the field and I'm always looking for new opportunites to expand on what I know. I have experiences in quite a few languages such as Javascript, Node.JS, Python, MySQL, and C++. My favorite language, however, is Java. I have done various projects in the language. I'm always looking for new opportunities to expand my knowledge so if you have any opportunities for me feel free to contact me!
