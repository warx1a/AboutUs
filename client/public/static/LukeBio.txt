Hello! My name is Luther Jensen and I want to thank you for checking out my website. Programming has always been a passion of mine and I've been programming for almost a decade now. I first started writing code when I was 14 using Java for Runescape. Since then I have branched out into webpage development, extension development, enterprise software development, and financial/ crypto software. I also graduated from Southeast Community College with an associates degree in computer science.
<br>In my free time I enjoy walking my dogs, Maverick and Lulu. Cooking with my girlfriend is one of my favorite hobbies, and is a great way for us to spend quality time together. I'm also an avid reader and enjoy following world geopolitical events.
